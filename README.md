I am planning on learning the foundations of web development
so I researched and heard I need to study:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

Then I want to create projects that test my understanding of them.

Feel free to offer me advice. I would really appreciate it
and it will help me a lot. I'm also using sololearn and a 
a textbook to make the learning process easier
