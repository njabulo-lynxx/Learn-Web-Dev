        <h1>Fruit Parade</h1>
        <p>The time for the event is drawing near. Here's a sample of what to expect!</p>

        <h2>1. Fruits</h2>
        <p>We have a total of eight fruits available. Which are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Apple</li>
            <li>Banana</li>
            <li>Peach</li>
            <li>Orange</li>
            <li>Strawberry</li>
            <li>Lemon</li>
            <li>Watermelon</li>
            <li>Pineapple</li>
        </ul>
        <p>They will be used in a variety of games and activities.</p>

        <h2>2. Games</h2>
        <p>To avoid spoilers I am only going to mention a single game.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><b>Fruit Juggling</b></dt>
            <dd>A person is given a <u>maximum of 6</u> of the same or different fruits to juggle. <br>
                The <strong>MORE</strong> fruits juggled, the <strong>GREATER</strong> the reward!
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>These are the fruits to be handed to the juggler in the appropriate order:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Lemon</li>
            <li>Peach</li>
            <li>Apple</li>
            <li>Lemon</li>
            <li>Peach</li>
            <li>Apple</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>3. More!</h2>
        <p>There are so many things that will happen but as I mentioned, 
            <i>"I cannot spoil the surprise for you!"</i> <br>
            I'm looking forward to seeing you there. Until then, take care!!!
