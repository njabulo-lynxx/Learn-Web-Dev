    <h1>Page Layout</h1>
    <p>Page layout refers to the arrangement of elements on a web page. A well-designed layout can enhance 
        user experience and make content more accessible. Common layout techniques include:</p>

    <h2>1. Header</h2>
    <p>The header typically contains the website's logo, navigation menu, and sometimes a search bar. It is 
        usually placed at the top of the page.</p>

    <h2>2. Main Content</h2>
    <p>This section contains the primary content of the page, such as articles, images, videos, or other media. 
        It is often divided into multiple sections or columns for better organization.</p>

    <h2>3. Sidebar</h2>
    <p>A sidebar is an additional section that can contain supplementary information, links, advertisements, 
        or widgets. It is usually positioned on the left or right side of the main content.</p>

    <h2>4. Footer</h2>
    <p>The footer is located at the bottom of the page and typically includes contact information, copyright 
        notices, and links to important pages like privacy policy or terms of service.</p>
