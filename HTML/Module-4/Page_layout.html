    <h1>Page Layout</h1>
    <p>Page layout refers to the arrangement of elements on a web page. A well-designed layout can enhance 
        user experience and make content more accessible. Common layout techniques include:</p>

    <h2>1. Header</h2>
    <p>The header typically contains the website's logo, navigation menu, and sometimes a search bar. It is 
        usually placed at the top of the page.</p>

    <h2>2. Main Content</h2>
    <p>This section contains the primary content of the page, such as articles, images, videos, or other media. 
        It is often divided into multiple sections or columns for better organization.</p>

    <h2>3. Sidebar</h2>
    <p>A sidebar is an additional section that can contain supplementary information, links, advertisements, 
        or widgets. It is usually positioned on the left or right side of the main content.</p>

    <h2>4. Footer</h2>
    <p>The footer is located at the bottom of the page and typically includes contact information, copyright 
        notices, and links to important pages like privacy policy or terms of service.</p>

    <h1>Advanced Layout Techniques</h1>
    <p>In addition to the basic layout structure, there are several advanced techniques that can enhance the design and functionality of a web page:</p>

    <h2>1. Responsive Design</h2>
    <p>With the increasing use of mobile devices, responsive design has become essential. It allows web 
        pages to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent user experience 
        across all devices.</p>

    <h2>2. Grid Layout</h2>
    <p>Grid layout is a powerful CSS technique that allows for the creation of complex and flexible layouts. 
        It divides the page into rows and columns, making it easier to align and position elements.</p>

    <h2>3. Flexbox</h2>
    <p>Flexbox is another CSS layout module that provides a more efficient way to lay out, align, and 
        distribute space among items in a container. It is particularly useful for creating responsive layouts.</p>

    <h2>4. White Space</h2>
    <p>White space, or negative space, is the empty space between elements on a page. Proper use of white 
        space can improve readability and create a more visually appealing design.</p>

    <h2>5. Visual Hierarchy</h2>
    <p>Visual hierarchy refers to the arrangement of elements in a way that indicates their importance. This 
        can be achieved through the use of size, color, contrast, and placement. A clear visual hierarchy 
        helps users navigate the page and find information quickly.</p>

    <h2>6. Consistency</h2>
    <p>Maintaining consistency in design elements such as colors, fonts, and spacing can create a cohesive 
        and professional look. Consistency also helps users understand how to interact with the page and 
        what to expect from different elements.</p>

    <h2>7. Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Ensuring that a web page is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, is crucial. 
        This can be achieved by following accessibility guidelines, such as providing alternative text for 
        images, using semantic HTML, and ensuring sufficient color contrast.</p>

    <h2>8. Performance</h2>
    <p>Optimizing the performance of a web page is important for providing a good user experience. This can 
        be achieved by minimizing the use of large images, reducing the number of HTTP requests, and using 
        efficient coding practices.</p>

    <h2>9. Testing and Iteration</h2>
    <p>Regularly testing the layout on different devices and browsers is essential to ensure that it works 
        as intended. Iterating on the design based on user feedback and analytics can help improve the 
        overall user experience.</p>

    <h2>10. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>A well-designed page layout is essential for creating an engaging and user-friendly website. By 
        considering factors such as visual hierarchy, consistency, accessibility, and performance, designers 
        can create layouts that effectively communicate their message and provide a positive experience for 
        users.</p>
