    <h1>Best Practices for Writing HTML</h1>
    <p>When writing HTML, it's important to follow best practices to ensure your code is clean, efficient, and accessible. Here are some key guidelines to keep in mind:</p>
    
    <h2>1. Use Semantic HTML</h2>
    <p>Semantic HTML elements clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. For example, use <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> instead of generic <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Keep Your Code Organized</h2>
    <p>Indent your code properly and use consistent formatting. This makes it easier to read and maintain. Group related elements together and use comments to explain sections of your code.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Use Meaningful Names for IDs and Classes</h2>
    <p>Choose descriptive names for your IDs and classes that reflect their purpose or content. This improves readability and helps with CSS styling and JavaScript functionality.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Validate Your HTML</h2>
    <p>Use an HTML validator to check your code for errors and ensure it adheres to web standards. This helps improve compatibility across different browsers and devices.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Optimize for Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Ensure your HTML is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Use appropriate ARIA roles, provide alt text for images, and ensure proper heading structure.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Minimize Inline Styles and Scripts</h2>
    <p>Avoid using inline styles and scripts within your HTML. Instead, link to external CSS and JavaScript files to keep your HTML clean and separate content from presentation.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Use Comments Wisely</h2>
    <p>Add comments to explain complex sections of your code, but avoid over-commenting. Comments should enhance understanding without cluttering the code.</p>
    
    <p>By following these best practices, you can create well-structured, maintainable, and accessible HTML documents that provide a better experience for all users.</p>
